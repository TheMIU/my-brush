        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 26, 2024</p>

        <p>Welcome to <strong>My Brush</strong>! Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy outlines how we
            handle user data and protect your privacy while using our app.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Our app, <strong>My Brush</strong>, does not collect, store, or share any personal information, device
            information, or sensitive user data. Your use of <strong>My Brush</strong> is anonymous, and we do not
            require you to provide any personal data to use the app's features.</p>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>Since <strong>My Brush</strong> does not collect any personal or device information, no data is used or
            processed outside of the app.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app only requires permissions necessary for drawing and exporting images (such as access to storage for
            saving files). These permissions are strictly used for enhancing your experience and are not used for
            collecting any data.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>My Brush</strong> does not use third-party services that may collect information from your device or
            app usage.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any
            changes. Any changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately upon being published.</p>
